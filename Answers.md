1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a UI library, that makes creating and maintaining large amounts of data more organized, DRY, and dynamic. Through the use of Components, we can create reusable blocks of code, with props, we can input data over a larger scope, and through state we can make our sites more interactive.

1. Describe component state.

State is a piece of data that we design, and assign to different elements. This allows for a greater dynamic use in our code.

1. Describe props.

Props are essentially placeholders for data that will come from other files, perhaps in the form of text, state, numbers, or any other form of data.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are hooks that allow us to set changes to our code to happen at different points. Using a dependency array at the end of the hook, we can set the effect to wait until it detects a change in whatever props or state we put into the array.
